# sequence
Explanation:
This code implements a program to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1.

The fibonacci_sequence function takes a parameter n, which represents the number of terms to generate, and performs the following steps:

It initializes an empty list called sequence to store the Fibonacci sequence.
If n is greater than or equal to 1, it appends 0 to the sequence list as the first term.
If n is greater than or equal to 2, it appends 1 to the sequence list as the second term.
It then uses a for loop to generate the remaining terms of the sequence.
For each iteration, it calculates the next Fibonacci number by adding the two preceding numbers in the sequence (sequence[i-1] and sequence[i-2]).
The calculated number is appended to the sequence list.
Finally, the function returns the generated Fibonacci sequence.
In the main part of the code, the user is prompted to enter the number of terms they want in the Fibonacci sequence. The input is stored in the num_terms variable.
The fibonacci_sequence function is called with num_terms as an argument to generate the Fibonacci sequence. The resulting sequence is stored in the fibonacci list.
The program then prints the Fibonacci sequence up to the specified number of terms.

Please note that this code assumes that the user will provide a positive integer for the number of terms. Additional input validation and error handling may be necessary to handle invalid inputs or handle edge cases.
